# Introducing a simplified encyclopedia for kids! (demo version)

A demo of a safe and educational tool* for children powered by ChatGPT, but with additional capabilities to provide current and up-to-date / real-time information. 
.
This tool is designed with the safety of children in mind, offering a safe search function that filters out any inappropriate content (via Google's SafeSearch technology to filter explicit contents). Additionally, this tool provides accurate and updated facts and information sourced from credible sources such as Encyclopedia Britannica, Standard Wolfram, National Geographic, and Wonderopolis, and returns results that are comprehensible and easy for children to understand (via chatGPT's model GPT3.5-turbo to re-phrase them into age-appropriate level of contexts for young learners).
.
This demo intents to show that such a tool is easy and low cost to develop, tapping on currently available technologies, and can be a potential barrier-breaker to upgrade and promote learning as align to UN's SGD4.1 & 4.2 (inclusive and equitable quality education for all boys & girls). The approach behind this demo can be adopted into various specific use cases.
